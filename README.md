Sentiment analysis in Python typically works by employing natural language processing(NLP) techniques to analyze and understand the sentiment expressed in text. The process involves several steps:

Text Preprocessing: The text cleaning process involves removing irrelevant information, such as special characters, punctuation, and stopwords, from the text data.
Tokenization: The text is divided into individual words or tokens to facilitate analysis.
Feature Extraction: The text extraction process involves extracting relevant features from the text, such as words, n-grams, or even parts of speech.
Sentiment Classification: Machine learning algorithms or pre-trained models are used to classify the sentiment of each text instance. Researchers achieve this through supervised learning, where they train models on labeled data, or through pre-trained models that have learned sentiment patterns from large datasets.
Post-processing: The sentiment analysis results may undergo additional processing, such as aggregating sentiment scores or applying threshold rules to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
Evaluation: Researchers assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model using evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.
